\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

\Friending{} has limitations with respect to \abbrevation{G\&SD}.  Section ~\ref{sec:eventmatch} specifies the creation of events, specifically mixers, that ensure a match for all participants upon completion.  A mixer currently supports Heterosexual, Bisexual, Gay, and Lesbian matches.  With limited match support, the current version of \Friending{} does not support all \abbrevation{G\&SD}.  A future version may support matches providing more inclusivity for \abbrevation{G\&SD} individuals.

The following are limitations of \Friending{}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can only invite to an event by email address
\item You can only invite to a group by email address
\end{enumerate}
