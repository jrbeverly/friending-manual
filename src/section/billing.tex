\subsection{Paying for your account services}
\label{sec:billing-paying}
Paying for your account happens automatically.   You will need to set your billing information to use \Friending{}.   If \Friending{} is unable to bill your account, you will be unable to use \Friending{} until your billing information is corrected.  You will be billed on a monthly basis for your account.

You can see your billing information as specified in section ~\ref{sec:billing-view}.
