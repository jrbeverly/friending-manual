\subsection{Product overview}
\label{sec:overview}

\Friending{} is an online dating, friendship, and social networking mobile application that features user-created questionnaires and multiple choice questions.  \Friending{} has two primary features: joining groups to find people similar to you or registering for events happening in your local area.

You can create a group around one of your interests, then define questionnaires that can be used to match other members of the group.  You can join these groups and fill in questionnaires to be matched with members of the group.  The questionnaire answers are used to determine a mutual match based on the your and others responses.  You will receive a notification if a mutual match is found.

Events are managed by an event host that controls the event.  Each event has a questionnaire that you will fill out to join.  You can invite people to join your event, and when you are ready start the processing of pairing up people in the event.    The participants of your event will then be matched into pairs.  You will receive a notification when a match is set.
