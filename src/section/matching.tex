\label{sec:eventmatch}
\Friending{} works to enable mutual match by starting with design elements that can be used to express matching parameters. By first providing access to a variety of methods to define a match. Category weighting, question importance, answer score comparison. These design decisions help ensure that a questionnaire is able to balance the matching desires of the questionnaire designer and users.

When a questionnaire is submitted, \Friending{} compares each of the question responses. The primary factor is the comparison score which is based on comparing the two answers of the questionnaire. The question multipliers are then considered. This would be the question important, user importance and the overall category. These values are used to compute a comparison score. A score that is used by the matchmaking algorithm to determine a mutual match.

A mutual match is match with both parties satisfied but each part of the computer the match differently. These methods are covered in section a and section b.
